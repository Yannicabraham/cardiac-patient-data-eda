# 🫀 Heart Disease Patient Data Analysis

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of medical data from cardiac patients. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and potential risk factors associated with heart disease using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a publicly available heart disease dataset, which contains medical attributes of patients such as:

- Age, Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Target: presence or absence of heart disease

## ❓ Key Questions Explored

- How is heart disease distributed across age and gender?
- What is the relationship between chest pain type and heart disease?
- How do cholesterol levels and resting blood pressure vary among patients?
- Are there differences in heart disease prevalence based on ECG results?
- How does maximum heart rate achieved relate to disease presence?
- Are certain combinations of risk factors more common among affected individuals?
